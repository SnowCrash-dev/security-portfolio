# 🔐 Security Research Portfolio

Welcome! This is a curated collection of my cybersecurity research, CTFs, and IoT exploitation projects. My work focuses on offensive security, vulnerability analysis, and embedded system assessments.

## 📡 Featured Projects

### 🛠️ IoTGoat Exploitation Lab  
Demonstrated OWASP IoT Top 10 vulnerabilities on a real device:
- 🧠 Insecure Defaults: Telnet service enabled by default (Port 65534)
- 🔐 Insecure Storage: Password hashes found in world-readable configs
- 📡 Insecure Data Transfer: Intercepted plaintext POST credentials
- 📥 Lack of Secure Update Mechanism: Simulated a malicious firmware download
- 🧱 Outdated Components: Used deprecated SSH algorithms to gain root access

### 📦 Firmware Analysis Toolkit *(WIP)*  
Scripts to unpack, analyze, and reverse firmware used in embedded devices.
